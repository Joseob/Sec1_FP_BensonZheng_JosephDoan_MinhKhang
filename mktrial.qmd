# Introduction

This analysis explores the relationship between NBA player performance and compensation during the 2017-2018 season. We aim to understand which statistical metrics are most highly valued in the market for professional basketball players and identify patterns in how teams allocate their financial resources.

Our research questions include:

1.  What is the relationship between various player performance metrics and salary?
2.  Are certain positions compensated differently relative to their statistical contributions?
3.  How does player age affect the salary-performance relationship?
4.  Which statistical categories have the strongest correlation with compensation?
