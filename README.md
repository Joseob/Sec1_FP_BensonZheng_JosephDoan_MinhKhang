# Project Title: NBA Salary Analysis: Relationships Between Players' Performance, Experience, and Compensation

This project analyzes how player performance, age, and experience influence salary compensation in the NBA. It provides insights into league salary structures, contract tiers, and team spending patterns for the 2022–2023 season.

## Overview

In professional basketball, understanding salary allocation is vital for evaluating player value. This project explores how demographic and performance factors correlate with salary, with a focus on player age, experience, position, and team payrolls. Using NBA salary and performance data, we investigate compensation patterns across the league.

### Interesting Insight

One key insight is that NBA player salaries follow an "inverted U" pattern with age: players aged **30–34** earn the highest average salaries, while younger and older players earn less. Additionally, **experience** has a stronger correlation with salary than age, as shown in the figure below:
